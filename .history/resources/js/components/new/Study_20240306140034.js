                                        This is an extremely valid reason to consider getting global education. This is because whether you choose to stay abroad after 
                                        your studies or you choose to return to your home country, studying abroad contributes significantly to having a more global mindset, 
                                        which is highly favoured by employers as it directly converts in work done.

                                        This is why we encourage students to seek global certification through our study abroad program. As it provides them access to the

                                        as they can choose and apply based on their long-term goals.
